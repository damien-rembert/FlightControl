    // The application should operate in two parts: first, the user enters information about airplanes and flights in the airport asset control, after which the program offers the flight information service for the user. There are three operations in this latter flight control â€” printing the airplanes, printing the flights, and printing the information of a single airplane. In addition, the user may exit the program by choosing the option x. If the user enters an invalid command, the program asks for a command again.
